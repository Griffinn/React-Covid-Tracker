# React-Covid-Tracker
Created a COVID-19 Global Tracker web app using the diseases.sh API. It provides real-time worldwide COVID-19 statistics, including total cases, recoveries, and deaths. Users can also access country-specific data through a dropdown menu and explore data visually through interactive maps, tables, and graphs.
